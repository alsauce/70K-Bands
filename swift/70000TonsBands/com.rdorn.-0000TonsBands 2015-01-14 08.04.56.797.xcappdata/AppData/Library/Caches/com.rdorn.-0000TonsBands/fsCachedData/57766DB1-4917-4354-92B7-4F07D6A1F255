		<h2>TUSKA-FESTIVAL 2015 – FIRST BANDS ANNOUNCED, TICKETS ON SALE NOW</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>- LAMB OF GOD takes over Tuska for the first time, AMORPHIS and STRATOVARIUS to play their breakthrough albums<br />
- TUSKA launches Black Dining restaurant, black menu kitchen to serve festival goers<br />
- limited amount of early bird priced three-day tickets on sale now<br />
- TUSKA 2015 takes place at Suvilahti, Helsinki from Fri 26.6. to Sun 28.6.2015</p>
<p>The biggest metal festival in Nordic countries opens its doors next summer for the 18th time in its history. Suvilahti event field will once again be packed of metalheads and, of course, top-notch bands. Early bird priced three-day-tickets on sale now! </p>
<p>LAMB OF GOD hits Tuska stage for the first time in the summer 2015. The band takes the festival audience by storm with their hostile and thrashy guitar works, low-pitched and crawling vocals and grinding live energy. Needles to say, moshpit will be grouded. AMORPHIS travels back in time and plays the death metal milestone ”Tales From The Thousand Lakes” in its entirety to mark the album’s 20th anniversary. Composer-guitarist Esa Holopainen describes the concept as follows: ”Lakes will be played from beginning to end and show visuals are matched to the era in question. Guitars will be drop tuned to C and legs are steadily set to x.”  </p>
<p>Another legendary album played live at Tuska 2015 is ”Visions” by STRATOVARIUS. This power metal five-piece is about to amplify their breakthrough 10-tracker to the max with such anthems as ”Kiss Of Judas” and ”Black Diamond” among others. The album, originally released back in 1997, is still considered to be one of the cornerstone works wthin the genre. In addition, Tuska crowd will witness ”all killer, no filler” live attitude by Swedish BOMBUS and rhythms of mysterious stoner performed by Austin based THE SWORD.</p>
<p>At the festival area, the thing to talk about will be Black Dining restaurant launched by Tuska. Black kitchen’s black menu consisting of blackened main dishes serve vegetarian and carnivore diets alike. The darker the food, the gloomier the mood.</p>

Limited amount of three-day Tuska-tickets are on sale now. Early Bird price is set to 115 euros (including ticket agency’s service fee) and tickets are available until 24.12. if not sold out prior to the date.

		<h2>AMORPHIS &#8211; »Tales From The Thousand Lakes« 20th Anniversary tour announced!</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>AMORPHIS has just announced to be hitting the road in late December in celebration of the 20th Anniversary of their legendary 1994 release »Tales From The Thousand Lakes«. </p>
<p>Guitarist Esa Holopainen gives a retrospect on the band’s early days and explains how the tour came about: “This month (July 12) marked the 20th anniversary of the release of the by far most significant album of our career: »Tales From The Thousand Lakes«.<br />
The years have flown by, and it feels great to notice that the tooth of time has not diminished the value of the album, nor the popularity of its songs when performed live. ‘Black Winter Day’, ‘The Castaway’, ‘Into Hiding’ and ‘In The Beginning’ are still part of almost every AMORPHIS gig. Although we have played these songs hundreds of times, it is still as exciting as ever to see the joy in people’s faces and the sheer emotion evoked by, for example, the piano intro of Black Winter Day. When Tomi Joutsen joined the band, we reviewed the setlist in a new (old) light. It was perfectly clear that we would include more tracks from »Tales From The Thousand Lakes«– without forgetting our debut »The Karelian Isthmus«, of course.  At that point we understood how much »Tales From The Thousand Lakes« meant to people. Most of us have feelings about the 1990s that are brought back to mind by the songs from »Tales From The Thousand Lakes«, so we are certainly talking about nostalgia here. To honor the two-decade history of the album, we will embark on the Tales From The Thousand Lakes 20th Anniversary Tour. The shows of this tour will feature the »Tales From The Thousand Lakes« album in its entirety as well as some rarely performed AMORPHIS songs. Don your wigs and start the pit!”</p>
<p>Joining in the band on tour will be Swedish label mates AVATARIUM. </p>
<p>Commented guitarist Esa Holopainen: &#8220;We are really happy to have AVATARIUM as a special quest for Tales From The Thousand Lakes 20th Anniversary tour. A year ago on tour in Germany we hooked up with Nuclear Blast guys and they brought us several of their new releases. Being a huge fan of CANDLEMASS I was obviously really interested in AVATARIUM<br />
release. I guess this was one of the albums everybody enjoyed listening to and why not, the band and their music is great!&#8221;</p>

<p>26.12. D          Berlin                                                 &#8211; Huxley&#8217;s Neue Welt<br />

		<h2>HAMFERD to support AMORPHIS on east european leg in March 2014</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>Faroese doom metal band Hamferd has been confirmed as the sole support act for Finnish melancholic dark metal masters Amorphis, whose second leg of the “Circle” world tour starts in the middle of march 2014.<br />
This is a unique bill for fans of dark metal music. Both bands are inspired by their Nordic traditions and surroundings. Amorphis draw huge inspiration from the Finnish national epic Kalevala and channel it through dark musical journey, whereas Hamferd shroud their Faroese folklore and doomladen hymns with a spellbinding uniqueness and mysticism. This is not the first time both bands are on the same bill. Hamferd had already done a support gig with Amorphis back in november in Hamburg, which was a great success. Hamferd guitarist Theodor Kapnas had the following to say about the upcoming tour:</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re really looking forward to hitting the road again! The clear highlight of our last European tour was opening for Amorphis in Hamburg, which was an incredible experience for us. So we&#8217;re delighted that we&#8217;ve been given the opportunity to open for Amorphis for an entire tour. Hope to see lots of people at the shows”.<br />
Hamferd will support on the European leg of the tour. The tour is presented by ROCK HARD, ZILLO, BLAST!, METALNEWS.DE.</p>

		<h2>The Opera Festival Rocks!</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>Amorphis to gig in Olavinlinna Castle on July 13, 2014!</p>
<p>The idea of inviting Amorphis along to Savonlinna was, reports the Festival’s Artistic Director Jorma Silvasti, born of Aulis Sallinen’s Kullervo: “I asked myself what other front-line Finnish music views the male soulscape through the eyes of The Kalevala. I wanted something to offer an audience that may never before have visited Savonlinna during the Opera Festival.”</p>
<p>The programme for the Amorphis concert will include items from its most recent album, Circle, and ones from its Eclipse album retelling the story of Kullervo. For lyrics based on texts by Paavo Haavikko and translations by Anselm Hollo helped Amorphis to rocket to the ranks of the Finnish metal elite.</p>
<p>Amorphis, a band that has been steadily making a name for itself in Finnish metal for more than two decades now, is to set the Savonlinna Opera Festival rocking in July 2014. The band’s 11th album, Circle, released in spring 2013 was voted Album of the Year by the prestigious British Metal Hammer magazine.</p>
<p>Initially a death metal act, Amorphis has since branched out into other genres such as progressive metal, but on the whole even its heaviest music has been quite melodic and its vocals vary from pure to “growling”. Melodic guitar riffs have nevertheless always been a distinguishing feature of its style.</p>
<p>Musical regeneration has kept the wheels turning and Amorphis has had numerous gigs abroad in recent years. Its albums drawing on the Finnish national epic, The Kalevala, and the ancient folk poetry of The Kanteletar in time influenced the signature Amorphis sound and won the band new fans all round the world. Amorphis could in fact be called the heavy ambassador for Finnish mythology.</p>

		<h2>The Album of The Year -award!</h2>
	</div>
	
	<p>Amorphis received Metal Hammer´s &#8220;The Album of The Year&#8221; -award from the album &#8220;Circle&#8221;, released last April. </p>
<p>&#8220;For us, Album of the Year award is a great recognition for the work done so far. Especially when we got it from our 11th studioalbum. It is good to continue touring&#8221;, guitarist Esa Holopainen said.</p>
<p>Amorphis´s &#8220;Circle World Tour&#8221; will continue to Russia with 11 concerts. After Russia Amorphis will tour Australia and China for the first time. Check all Amorphis -gigs from <a href="http://amorphis.net/?page_id=5" title="HERE">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Circle&#8221; -album, released 19. April 2013, went straight to #1 on Finnish Official album chart and #1 on Rumba´s album chart. &#8220;Circle&#8221;´s positions on British Rock Album Chart (#15) and on German Album Chart (#13) are the band&#8217;s best so far in these countries. Amorphis was on Sweden´s album chart for the first time on their career. First week at #33. &#8220;Circle&#8221; was produced and mixed by Peter Tägtgren (Hypocrisy and Pain).</p>
